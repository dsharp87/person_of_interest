    <p>This platform allows users to take quizes that will help us identify your interests and desires. Our matching algorithm will then identify other users who share your interests and allow you to chat with them.  Once you've taken at least one quiz, you will be able to use our chat hub, where you can message in real time other users who are currently logged in. To get started  click the "take quiz" button below.  Or if you are a returning user jump right into chat by clicking the "chat" button.</p>
